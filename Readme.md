## Config directory for my xmonad config :)

Clone waymonad (recursive) into here (must be called waymonad).
Then build with `cabal new-build`.

This can contain as many configs as required.
I will probably keep this up to date, but there should be no need to pull.

Not even much of a need to ever clone, just get the `cabal.project` and
`waymonad-config.cabal`.
